## Overview

The `poll.expresso-ts.com` platform is an interactive community engagement tool designed for running specific voting campaigns. Examples include selecting badges for Holopin and other relevant community decisions. Each vote is email-validated to ensure authentic participation and high-quality leads. Geographical data is also collected for demographic analysis and better lead segmentation.

- **NextJS**: Frontend framework
- **ShadcnUI**: UI components
- **ExpressoTS**: Backend framework
- **SQLite**: Database (in development; considering other options like **ScyllaDB**)

## Features

- **Community Voting**: Enable community members to participate in decision-making through various campaigns.

## Future Plans
